		<h2>The Turkish Art of Marbling</h2>
		<p>
			Marbling is the art of creating colorful patterns by sprinkling
			and brushing color pigments on a pan of oily water
			and then transforming this pattern to paper.
			The special tools of the trade are brushes of horsehair bound to
			straight rose twigs, a deep tray made of unknotted pinewood, natural
			earth pigments, cattle gall and tragacanth.
			It is believed to be invented in the thirteenth century Turkistan.
			This decorative art then spread to China, India and Persia and Anatolia.
			Seljuk and Ottoman calligraphers and artists used marbling to decorate books,
			imperial decrees, official correspondence and documents.
			New forms and techniques were perfected in the process and
			Turkey remained the center of marbling for many centuries.
			Up until the 1920's, marblers had workshops in the Beyazit district of Istanbul,
			creating for both the local and European market, where it is known as Turkish marble paper.
